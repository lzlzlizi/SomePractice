# 1358. Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters

Given a string `s` consisting only of characters *a*, *b* and *c*.

Return the number of substrings containing **at least** one occurrence of all these characters *a*, *b* and *c*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcabc"
Output: 10
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc", "bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc" and "abc" (again). 
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aaacb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "aaacb", "aacb" and "acb". 
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

* `3 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^4`
* `s` only consists of *a*, *b* or *c* characters.







```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        da = {'a':0,'b':0,'c':0}
        
        res = i = 0
        for j in range(len(s)):
            da[s[j]] += 1
            while all(da.values()):
                da[s[i]] -= 1
                i += 1
            res += i # this is res of moving left point, however, when ever we move the right, if we once moved left, then it will add all the time
            
        return res
    
```
