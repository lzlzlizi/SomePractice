# 1404. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number in Binary Representation to One

Given a number `s` in their binary representation. Return the number of steps to reduce it to 1 under the following rules:

* If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2.
* If the current number is odd, you have to add 1 to it.

It's guaranteed that you can always reach to one for all testcases.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "1101"
Output: 6
Explanation: "1101" corressponds to number 13 in their decimal representation.
Step 1) 13 is odd, add 1 and obtain 14. 
Step 2) 14 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 7.
Step 3) 7 is odd, add 1 and obtain 8.
Step 4) 8 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 4.  
Step 5) 4 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 2. 
Step 6) 2 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 1.  
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "10"
Output: 1
Explanation: "10" corressponds to number 2 in their decimal representation.
Step 1) 2 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 1.  
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "1"
Output: 0
```





## stupid solution - python整数不会溢出

**python string2int: int(s,进制)**

```python
#转十进制
class Solution:
    def numSteps(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = int(s,2)
        step = 0
        while n != 1:
            if n % 2 == 0:
                n //= 2
            else:
                n += 1
            step += 1
        return step

```



## 正常操作



* 二进制整除二相当于右移操作，就是截断掉最后一位
* 10000000 之类的就整除len - 1 次就是一了
* 否则 遇到尾部是1， 就要多一步，并且前面位数要加一或者多一个1，最终位数要加一，所以除了长度外还要加一
  * 例如 111 加1是一个step
  * 111+1 = 1000， 多了一位
  * 如果之间有0（strip之后），还要多一个1
