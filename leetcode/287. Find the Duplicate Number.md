# 287. Find the Duplicate Number


Given an array *nums* containing *n* + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and *n* (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```

**Note:**

1. You **must not** modify the array (assume the array is read only).
2. You must use only constant, *O*(1) extra space.
3. Your runtime complexity should be less than *O*(*n*2).
4. There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

## Solution

* Some remarks
  * index->value can be viewed as a link between two points 
  * head is 0, but 0 is not in the nums, which is the same as head in a linked list
  * the beginning of a loop is the repeated number.

```python
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        dog = nums[nums[0]]
        fantasy = nums[nums[nums[0]]]
        while dog != fantasy:
            dog = nums[dog]
            fantasy = nums[nums[fantasy]]
        head = nums[0]
        while head != dog:
            head = nums[head]
            dog = nums[dog]
        return head
            
```
