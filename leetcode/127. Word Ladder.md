# 127. Word Ladder

Given two words (*beginWord* and *endWord*), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from *beginWord* to *endWord*, such that:

1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.
2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that *beginWord* is *not* a transformed word.

**Note:**

* Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
* All words have the same length.
* All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
* You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
* You may assume *beginWord* and *endWord* are non-empty and are not the same.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output: 5

Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
return its length 5.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output: 0

Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.
```





## solution



* BFS
* 对当前queue里面的遍历，而不是候选list
* visited 记录已经遍历过的
* deque:
  * popleft 就是原来queue的get
  * append就是put
  * 可以理解为 append， pop 和list一样，appendleft, popleft 是新功能



```python
class Solution:
    def ladderLength(self, beginWord: str, endWord: str, wordList: List[str]) -> int:
        w = set(wordList)
        if endWord not in w:
            return 0
        
        q = collections.deque([(beginWord,1)])
        visited = set()
        alpha = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
        while q:
            word, l = q.popleft()
            if word == endWord:
                return l
            for i in range(len(word)):
                for c in alpha:
                    t = word[:i] + c + word[i+1:]
                    if t in w and t not in visited:
                        visited.add(t)
                        q.append((t, l+1))
            
        return 0
            
```
