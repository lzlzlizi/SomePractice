# 438. Find All Anagrams in a String

Given a string **s** and a **non-empty** string **p**, find all the start indices of **p**'s anagrams in **s**.

Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings **s** and **p** will not be larger than 20,100.

The order of output does not matter.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"

Output:
[0, 6]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input:
s: "abab" p: "ab"

Output:
[0, 1, 2]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
```

        l = len(p)
        p = collections.Counter(p)
        da = collections.defaultdict(int)
        left = right = 0
        
        res = []
        required = 0
        while right  < len(s):
            c = s[right]
            if c in p:
                da[c] += 1
                if da[c] == p[c]:
                    required += 1
            # move left to the right place if have all the characters       
            while right - left + 1  > l:
                c = s[left]
                if c in p:
                    da[c] -= 1
                    if da[c] < p[c]:
                        required -= 1
                left += 1
                
            if required == len(p):
                res.append(left)
            right += 1
            
        return res
