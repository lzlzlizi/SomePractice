# 75. Sort Colors

Given an array with *n* objects colored red, white or blue, sort them **[in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

**Note:** You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

**Example:**

```
Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

**Follow up:**

* A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
  First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
* Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?



## Solution

This is a well known problem called dutch flag problem, which aims to partition the nums into three areas, low, median, high.



The solution is based on the following idea:

* we can maintain three pointers, and make sure there are the three partition points of the final results

```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        dog, reality, fantasy = 0, 0, len(nums)
        while reality < fantasy:
            if nums[reality] < 1 :
                nums[dog], nums[reality] = nums[reality], nums[dog]
                dog += 1
                reality += 1
            elif nums[reality] > 1:
                fantasy -= 1
                nums[reality], nums[fantasy] = nums[fantasy], nums[reality]
                
            else:
                reality += 1

```
