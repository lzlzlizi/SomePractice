# 42. Trapping Rain Water

Given *n* non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. **Thanks Marcos** for contributing this image!

**Example:**

```
Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
```



## Solution

First, water must be in the position in(2, len - 1). Therefore, we move the barrier from the both side.

If $j$ has water in it, then there must be two bars on both side of $j$ that are higher than $j$. In other words, if we have have  $i,j$, than the none-empty space between $i$ and $j$ must be the minimum of $i,j$ product the gap between them, if we subtract the solid area, we get water.

Therefore, we move two points from both side of the area, keep track the maximum bar and add the non-empty space and subtract solid space, we can get the final results. 



```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(height) < 3:
            return 0
        l = 0
        r = len(height) - 1
        lmax = height[l]
        rmax = height[r] 
        res = 0
        while l < r:
            if lmax <= rmax:
                res += lmax - height[l]
                l += 1
                lmax = max(height[l], lmax)
            else:
                res += rmax - height[r]
                r -= 1
                rmax = max(height[r], rmax)
        return res 
```
