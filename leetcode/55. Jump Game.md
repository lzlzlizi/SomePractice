# 55. Jump Game

Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum
             jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
```



## solution

we can travel from the end to the head to see if the current node can reach the end

However,  if check from the next one to the furtherest one, that will be $O(n^2)$, we can just check if the reachable lays in the range.



```python
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return True
        
        minstep = 1
        for i in range(len(nums)-2,-1,-1):
            steps = nums[i]
            if steps >= minstep:
                minstep = 1
            else:
                minstep += 1
        
        return minstep == 1
                
```
