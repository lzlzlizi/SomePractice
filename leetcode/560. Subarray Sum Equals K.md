# 560. Subarray Sum Equals K

Given an array of integers and an integer **k**, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to **k**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2
```



**Note:**

1. The length of the array is in range [1, 20,000].
2. The range of numbers in the array is [-1000, 1000] and the range of the integer **k** is [-1e7, 1e7].



## 

$O(n^2)$  Time Limit Exceeded

use a array to store sum and update them according to the iteration times 



```python
class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        s = [0] * len(nums)
        for i,t in enumerate(nums):
            s[i] = t + s[i-1] if i>=1 else t
            if s[i] == k:
                res += 1
        
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
            for j in range(i+1,len(nums)):
                s[j] = s[j] - nums[i]
                if s[j] == k:
                    res += 1
        return res
```



## $O(n\log n)$ 

The idea behind this approach is as follows: If the cumulative sum(repreesnted by sum[i] for sum upto $i^{th}$ index upto two indices is the same, the sum of the elements lying in between those indices is zero. Extending the same thought further, if the cumulative sum upto two indices, say i*i* and j is at a difference of k i.e. if sum[i] - sum[j] = k, the sum of elements lying between indices i and j is k.



```python
class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        da = collections.defaultdict(int)

        s = res = 0
        da[s] += 1
        for t in nums:
            s += t
            res += da[s-k]
            da[s] += 1
        return res
```
