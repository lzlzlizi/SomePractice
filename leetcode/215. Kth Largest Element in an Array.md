# 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array

Find the **k**th largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2
Output: 5
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 4
Output: 4
```

**Note:**
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.



## Use minheap 

```python
import heapq
class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        a = [nums[0]]
        heapq.heapify(a)
        for t in nums[1:]:
            if len(a) == k:
                if t > a[0]:
                    heapq.heappushpop(a,t)
            else:
                heapq.heappush(a,t)
  
        return a[0]
```

$O(N\log K)$
