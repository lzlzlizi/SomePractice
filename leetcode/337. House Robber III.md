# 337. House Robber III

- The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

  Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.

  **Example 1:**

  ```
  Input: [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
  
       3
      / \
     2   3
      \   \ 
       3   1
  
  Output: 7 
  Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
  ```

  **Example 2:**

  ```
  Input: [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]
  
       3
      / \
     4   5
    / \   \ 
   1   3   1
  
  Output: 9
  Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
  ```

## Solution

* BFS之后从下向上DP

```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        q = []
        q.append(root)
        level = []
        while q:
            L = len(q)
            t = []
            for _ in range(L):
                c = q.pop(0)
                t.append(c)
                if c.left:
                    q.append(c.left)
                if c.right:
                    q.append(c.right)
            level.append(t)
        DP = {None:[0,0]}
        while level:
            nodes = level.pop()
            for node in nodes:
                ml_rob = DP[node.left][1]
                mr_rob = DP[node.right][1]
                ml_wait = DP[node.left][0]
                mr_wait = DP[node.right][0]
                DP[node] = ([max(ml_rob + mr_rob, ml_rob + mr_wait, ml_wait + mr_rob, ml_wait + mr_wait), node.val + ml_wait + mr_wait])
             
        return max(DP[root])
```

* 递归方法

```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def f(root):
            if not root:
                return 0,0
            lw,lr = f(root.left)
            rw,rr = f(root.right)
            return max(lr+rw, lw+rr,lr+rr, lw + rw), root.val + lw + rw
            
        return max(f(root))
```
