# 200. Number of Islands

Given a 2d grid map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
11110
11010
11000
00000

Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
11000
11000
00100
00011

Output: 3
```



**This problem is almost the same as one of the  three problems in NJU 2018 cs summer on site interview, where I did not know how to do DFS in a matrix and had forgotten how to define a function in c++/c :). If I worked on leetcode top 100 with c++ two years ago,  Hefei could have had nothing to do with me then.**



```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        if not grid:
            return 0
        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])
        
        visited = set()
        
        def dfs(i,j):
            if (i,j) in visited:
                return
            
            visited.add((i,j))
            if i - 1 >= 0 and grid[i-1][j] == '1':
                dfs(i-1,j)
            if i + 1 < m and grid[i+1][j] == '1':
                dfs(i+1,j)
            if j -1 >= 0 and grid[i][j-1] == '1':
                dfs(i,j-1)
            if j + 1 < n and grid[i][j+1] == '1':
                dfs(i,j+1)
                
        res = 0
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == '1' and (i,j) not in visited :
                    res += 1
                    dfs(i,j)
        return res
            
```
