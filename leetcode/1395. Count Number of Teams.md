# 1395. Count Number of Teams

There are `n` soldiers standing in a line. Each soldier is assigned a **unique** `rating` value.

You have to form a team of 3 soldiers amongst them under the following rules:

* Choose 3 soldiers with index (`i`, `j`, `k`) with rating (`rating[i]`, `rating[j]`, `rating[k]`).
* A team is valid if: (`rating[i] < rating[j] < rating[k]`) or (`rating[i] > rating[j] > rating[k]`) where (`0 <= i < j < k < n`).

Return the number of teams you can form given the conditions. (soldiers can be part of multiple teams).

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: rating = [2,5,3,4,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can form three teams given the conditions. (2,3,4), (5,4,1), (5,3,1). 
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: rating = [2,1,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: We can't form any team given the conditions.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: rating = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 4
```





就是计算递增或者递减的三元组数量

类似暴力，循环中间的内部循环两边

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int numTeams(vector<int>& rating) {
        int res = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<rating.size();i++){
            int ls=0,lb=0,rs=0,rb=0;
            for(int j=0; j<i;j++){
                if(rating[j]<rating[i])
                    ls ++;
                else if(rating[j]>rating[i])
                    lb ++;
            }
            for(int j=i+1;j < rating.size();j++){
                if(rating[j]<rating[i])
                    rs ++;
                else if(rating[j]>rating[i])
                    rb ++;
            }
            res += ls * rb + lb * rs;
        } 
        return res;
    }
    
};
```
