# 322. Coin Change

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money *amount*. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
Output: 3 
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
```



## Solution

DP[i] means the minimal number of coins needed to change the given amount

```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        if not coins or amount == 0:
            return 0
        
        DP = [0] * (amount + 1)
        
        for i in range(1, amount + 1):
            temp = []
            for c in reversed(coins):
                if i % c == 0:
                    temp.append(i // c)
                    break
                elif c < i and DP[i -c] != -1:
                    temp.append(DP[i - c] + 1)
                

            DP[i] = min(temp) if temp else -1

        return DP[amount]
```
