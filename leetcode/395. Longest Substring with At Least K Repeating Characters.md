# 395. Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters

Find the length of the longest substring ***T\*** of a given string (consists of lowercase letters only) such that every character in ***T\*** appears no less than *k* times.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
s = "aaabb", k = 3

Output:
3

The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input:
s = "ababbc", k = 2

Output:
5

The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
```





## Solution



注意到只有26个字母，并且当某个字母在总的str里面出现次数小于k的时候，它就不可能在答案里面

所以只要将他们当做划分点即可，判断之间 的所有substring









 

```python
class Solution:
    def longestSubstring(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        if not s:
            return 0
        
        da = collections.Counter(s)
        if all([da[c]>=k for c in da]):
            return len(s)
        
        left = 0
        right = 0
        res = 0
        while right < len(s):
            c = s[right]
            if da[c] < k:
                res = max(res, self.longestSubstring(s[left:right],k))
                left = right + 1
            right += 1
        
        return max(res, self.longestSubstring(s[left:],k))
```
