# 76. Minimum Window Substring

Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).

**Example:**

```
Input: S = "ADOBECODEBANC", T = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
```

**Note:**

* If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string `""`.
* If there is such window, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.



## Solution

## Moving Window

This is a classical problem, that can be solved by moving windows, or can say, two pointers. We maintain two pointers, left and right, to expand and contract the window respectively. 
First, we turn the target pattern into a word frequency table(dict), then we construct an empty dict and move right to add a character into it and subtract a character when moving left. When the current dict is equal to the target one, we compare the window length and update the result.

**My try**

```python
class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        if not t or not s:
            return ''
        t = collections.Counter(t)
        da = collections.defaultdict(int)
        
        left = right = 0
        ll = 0
        rr = len(s)+1
        while True:
            if all([da[k] >= t[k] if k in da else False for k in t]):
                while True:
                    if right - left < rr - ll:
                        ll,rr = left,right
                    if s[left] in t:
                        da[s[left]] -= 1
                        if da[s[left]] < t[s[left]]:
                            left += 1
                            break
                    left += 1
                    
            else:
                if right == len(s):
                    break
                ss = s[right]
                if ss in t:
                    da[ss] += 1
   
                right += 1


        return s[ll:rr] if rr <= len(s) else ''
```



**Solution by leetcode: use a number to track the distinct characters**



```python
class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        if not t or not s:
            return ''
        t = collections.Counter(t)
        da = collections.defaultdict(int)
        
        left = right = 0
        ll = 0
        rr = len(s)+1
         # formed is used to keep track of how many unique characters in t are present in the current window in its desired frequency.
    # e.g. if t is "AABC" then the window must have two A's, one B and one C. Thus formed would be = 3 when all these conditions are met.
        formed = 0
        required = len(t)
        while right < len(s):
            c = s[right]
            da[c] += 1
            # If the frequency of the current character added equals to the desired count in t then increment the formed count by 1.
            if c in t and da[c] == t[c]:
                formed += 1
            while left <= right and formed == required:
                
                if right - left < rr - ll:
                    rr, ll = right, left
                c = s[left]
                da[c] -= 1
                if c in t and da[c] < t[c]:
                    formed -= 1
                left += 1
                
            right += 1
            

        return s[ll:rr+1] if rr <= len(s) else ''
```
