# 152. Maximum Product Subarray



Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
```





```python
class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        imin = imax = res = nums[0]
        for t in nums[1:]:
             # multiplied by a negative makes big number smaller, small number bigger
             # so we redefine the extremums by swapping them
            if t < 0:   imax, imin = imin, imax
            # max/min product for the current number is either the current number itself
            # or the max/min by the previous number times the current one
            imax, imin = max(t, imax*t), min(t, imin*t)
            res = max(res,imax)
        return res
```
