# 72. Edit Distance

Given two words *word1* and *word2*, find the minimum number of operations required to convert *word1* to *word2*.

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

1. Insert a character
2. Delete a character
3. Replace a character

**Example 1:**

```
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```



## Solution

This is a classical DP problem.

$DP[i,j]$ means edit distance of $a[i:], b[j:]$

there are three possible movements:

* delete $x[i]$
* add $y[j]$ before $a[i]$
* replace $x[i]$ with $y[j]$

```python
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        m = len(word1)
        n = len(word2)

        res = [i for i in range(n, -1, -1)]
        
        for i in range(m-1, -1, -1):
            new =  [0] * (n + 1)
            new[-1] = 1 + res[-1]
            for j in range(n-1, -1, -1):
                new[j] = min((1 if word1[i] != word2[j] else 0) + res[j+1], 1 + new[j+1], 1 + res[j])
            res = new 
            
        return res[0]
```
