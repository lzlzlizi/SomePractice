# 1351. Count Negative Numbers in a Sorted Matrix

Given a `m * n` matrix `grid` which is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise. 

Return the number of **negative** numbers in `grid`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [[4,3,2,-1],[3,2,1,-1],[1,1,-1,-2],[-1,-1,-2,-3]]
Output: 8
Explanation: There are 8 negatives number in the matrix.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[3,2],[1,0]]
Output: 0
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,-1],[-1,-1]]
Output: 3
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: grid = [[-1]]
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 100`
* `-100 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`



## slightly different from 2D finding ?

Please refer to the perspicacious elaboration from **@ikeabord** as follows:
This solution uses the fact that the negative regions of the matrix will form a "staircase" shape, e.g.:

```
++++++
++++--
++++--
+++---
+-----
+-----
```

```python
class Solution:
    def countNegatives(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not grid:
            return 0

        m,n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        x = m - 1
        y = 0
        res = 0
        while x > -1:
            print(x,y)
            while  y < n and  grid[x][y] >= 0:
                y += 1
            res += n - y
            x -= 1
        return res
        
```
