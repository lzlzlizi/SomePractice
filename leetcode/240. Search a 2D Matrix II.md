# 240. Search a 2D Matrix II

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an *m* x *n* matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

* Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
* Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

**Example:**

Consider the following matrix:

```
[
  [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
  [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
  [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
  [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
  [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
]
```

Given target = `5`, return `true`.

Given target = `20`, return `false`.



## solution

This problem only has solution with $O(m+n)$ or $O(m\ln(n)$.

 $O(m+n)$  is searching from the top right, like searching a binary tree, where the left column is smaller than the current element, and the down row is larger than it.

```python
class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix, target):
        """
        :type matrix: List[List[int]]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if not matrix:
            return False
        m = len(matrix)
        n = len(matrix[0])

        x, y = 0, n-1
        while x < m and y >= 0:
            if matrix[x][y] == target:
                return True
            if matrix[x][y] > target:
                y -= 1 #  move left
            else:
                x += 1 # move down
        return False
        
```
