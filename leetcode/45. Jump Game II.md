# 45. Jump Game II

Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

**Example:**

```
Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2.
    Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

**Note:**

You can assume that you can always reach the last index.



**Easy but $O(n^2)$ DP** 

```python
class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        DP = [0] * len(nums)
        for i in range(len(nums)-2, -1, -1):
            DP[i] = min(DP[i+1:i+nums[i]+1]) + 1 if DP[i+1:i+nums[i]+1] else len(nums)
        return DP[0]
```



**BFS**

The idea is to maintain two pointers `left` and `right`, where left initialy set to be `0` and `right` set to be `nums[0]`.
So points between `0` and `nums[0]` are the ones you can reach by using just 1 jump.
Next, we want to find points I can reach using 2 jumps, so our new `left` will be set equal to `right`, and our new `right` will be set equal to the farest point we can reach by `two` jumps. which is:
`right = max(i + nums[i] for i in range(left, right + 1)`



```python
class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return 0
        l = 0
        r = nums[0]
        res = 1
        while r < len(nums) - 1:
            l,r = r, max([i + nums[i] for i in range(l,r+1,1)])
            res += 1
        return res
```
