# 41. First Missing Positive

Given an unsorted integer array, find the smallest missing positive integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,0]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [3,4,-1,1]
Output: 2
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [7,8,9,11,12]
Output: 1
```

**Note:**

Your algorithm should run in *O*(*n*) time and uses constant extra space.





## Solution

If there was no constrains about the time complexity or space complexity, then sort or dict will be fine.

In this situation, we can remove any number that is non-positive or greater than the len of nums. Then, travel all the place with index being the value of the previous visited position. When we visit a position, we update the new index and modify value to its index + 1(since python's index starts from 0 while the numbers starts from 1). After we visited all the positions, all numbers in nums will be in its right position. 

Then we check the nums to see which is the first one without being in the right place (i.e. nums[i] != i + 1), we return i+1.

```python
class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 1
        for i,t in enumerate(nums):
            if t < 1 or t > len(nums):
                nums[i] = 0
        i = 0
        
        while i < len(nums):
            ind = nums[i] - 1
            while ind != -1 and ind != nums[ind]- 1:
                ii = nums[ind] - 1
                nums[ind] = ind + 1
                ind = ii
            i += 1
            
        for i,t in enumerate(nums):
            if t != i+1:
                return i+1
        
        return t+1
```
