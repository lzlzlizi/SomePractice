# 1349. Maximum Students Taking Exam

Given a `m * n` matrix `seats` that represent seats distributions in a classroom. If a seat is broken, it is denoted by `'#'` character otherwise it is denoted by a `'.'` character.

Students can see the answers of those sitting next to the left, right, upper left and upper right, but he cannot see the answers of the student sitting directly in front or behind him. Return the **maximum** number of students that can take the exam together without any cheating being possible..

Students must be placed in seats in good condition.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/29/image.png)

```
Input: seats = [["#",".","#","#",".","#"],
                [".","#","#","#","#","."],
                ["#",".","#","#",".","#"]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Teacher can place 4 students in available seats so they don't cheat on the exam. 
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: seats = [[".","#"],
                ["#","#"],
                ["#","."],
                ["#","#"],
                [".","#"]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Place all students in available seats. 
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: seats = [["#",".",".",".","#"],
                [".","#",".","#","."],
                [".",".","#",".","."],
                [".","#",".","#","."],
                ["#",".",".",".","#"]]
Output: 10
Explanation: Place students in available seats in column 1, 3 and 5.
```

 

**Constraints:**

* `seats` contains only characters `'.' and``'#'.`
* `m == seats.length`
* `n == seats[i].length`
* `1 <= m <= 8`
* `1 <= n <= 8`





## DP

* Bitmasking DP  https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-students-taking-exam/discuss/503686/A-simple-tutorial-on-this-bitmasking-problem
* $x \in \{1,...,2^n\}$ 代表n个位置上是否坐人的所有情况
  * 二进制操作整数判断是否满足条件
  * 对每一列操作得到最优值
  * DP\[row\]\[x\]为在X的排列下，最优的值
  * We can use **(x >> i) & 1** to get i-th bit in state **x**, where **>>** is the right shift operation. If we are doing this in an if statement (i.e. to check whether the i-th bit is 1), we can also use **x & (1 << i)**, where the **<<** is the left shift operation.
  * We can use **(x & y) == x** to check if **x** is a subset of **y**. The subset means every state in **x** could be 1 only if the corresponding state in **y** is 1.
  * We can use **(x & (x >> 1)) == 0** to check if there are no adjancent valid states in **x**.
