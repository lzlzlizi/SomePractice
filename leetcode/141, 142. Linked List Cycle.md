## 141, 142. Linked List Cycle

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

Can you solve it using *O(1)* (i.e. constant) memory?

## Solution

min stack 不是让实现heap, 只要记录当前最小值就可以了

```python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head):
        while head != None:
            head.val = None
           
            if head.next == None:
                return False
            if head.next.val == None:
                return True
            head = head.next
```

# 142. Linked List Cycle II

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

**Note:** Do not modify the linked list.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

## Solution

**PYTHON 有 while...else...这个操作**

```python
# 暴力记录,挺快的
class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        visited = set()
        while head:
            visited.add(head)
            if head.next == None:
                return None
            if head.next in visited:
                return head.next
            head = head.next
        return None
# 两个指针的方法
class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return None
        # fantasy要么走一圈,要么两圈,一定会遇到狗
        dog = fantasy = head
        while fantasy and fantasy.next: 
            dog = dog.next
            fantasy = fantasy.next.next
            if dog == fantasy:
                break
        else:
            return None
        
        # fantasy遇到狗时, 狗也在圈里, 2*step_dog = step_fantasy
        # 圈长 + step_dog = step_fantasy
        # => step_dog = 圈长
        # loop起点 + 狗在圈中的距离 = step_dog = 圈长
        # => loop起点 = 圈长 - 狗在圈中的距离 = 狗在走到圈起始点的长度

  
        while head != dog:
            dog = dog.next
            head = head.next
        return head
```
