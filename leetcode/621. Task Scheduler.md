# 621. Task Scheduler

Given a char array representing tasks CPU need to do. It contains capital letters A to Z where different letters represent different tasks. Tasks could be done without original order. Each task could be done in one interval. For each interval, CPU could finish one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative cooling interval **n** that means between two **same tasks**, there must be at least n intervals that CPU are doing different tasks or just be idle.

You need to return the **least** number of intervals the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

 

**Example:**

```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
```

 

**Note:**

1. The number of tasks is in the range [1, 10000].
2. The integer n is in the range [0, 100].



## Solution

* 任务是一致的，所以只要按任务数目递减地做
* 维护一个递减的任务数目数据，按顺序做，判断间隔和n的关系

```python
class Solution:
    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        if n == 0:
            return len(tasks)
        tasks = collections.Counter(tasks)
        info = list(reversed(sorted(tasks.values())))
        res = 0
        while True:
            sleep = -1
            L = len(info)
            for i in range(L):
                t = info[i]
                sleep += 1
                res += 1
                info[i] -= 1
                if sleep == n:
                    info = list(reversed(sorted(info)))
                    break

            while info[-1] == 0:
                info.pop()
                if not info:
                    return res
                
            if sleep < n:
                res += n - sleep
              
```
