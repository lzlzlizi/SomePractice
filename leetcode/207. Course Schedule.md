# 207. Course Schedule

There are a total of *n* courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `n-1`.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

**Note:**

1. The input prerequisites is a graph represented by **a list of edges**, not adjacency matrices. Read more about [how a graph is represented](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs).
2. You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.



## Solution 

* just find the circle in the graph using DFS
* or topological sort using BFS



```python
# DFS
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        graph = [[] for _ in range(numCourses)]
        visited = set()
        current = set()
        for e in prerequisites:
            h,t = e
            graph[h].append(t)
        def DFS(n):
            if n in current:
                return  False
            if n in visited:
                return True
            children = graph[n]
            current.add(n)
            res = all([ DFS(c) for c in children])
            if res:
                current.remove(n)
                visited.add(n)
            return res
    
        return all([DFS(i) for i in range(numCourses)])
    
# BFS
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        graph = [[] for _ in range(numCourses)]
        indegree = [0]*numCourses 
        for e in prerequisites:
            h,t = e
            graph[h].append(t)
            indegree[t] += 1
            
        q = collections.deque()
        for i,t in enumerate(indegree):
            if t == 0:
                q.append(i)
        if len(q) == 0:
            return False
        visited = set(q)
        while q:
            n = q.popleft()
            for c in graph[n]:
                if c in visited:
                    return False
                indegree[c] -= 1
                if indegree[c] == 0:
                    visited.add(c)
                    q.append(c)
                                              
        return len(visited) == numCourses
        

```
