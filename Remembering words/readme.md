# simple app for remembering words using pyqt

* This little app was created when I was tired with GRE words memorizing. I thought, hey why not write a script to remember words in my way. 
* word info is get from dict.bing.com

## requirements 

One need Mysql to run this, and since it has been a long time when I write the app, I do not think I can remember how to initialize the database. But if anyone think this may be help, feel free to write the request on the 'issue', and I will try to help you set up the environment.
